title: "Hooknook: Like GitHub Pages for Your Server"

excerpt: |
    [GitHub Pages][pages] is a nifty feature that lets you automatically update a Web site with every `git push`. If you want the same functionality for sites you host on department servers, though, GitHub's thing won't work. [Hooknook][] is my solution.

I've [written][jekyll-post] that [Jekyll][], the ultrahip static site generator, is a great way to make academic Web sites. But once you've built your site with a static site generator, you'll need a nice way to automatically update your public-facing site whenever you make changes. This is doubly true if you're making a site with multiple authors: a [research group site][group-web], for example, or page for [a course or seminar][590g].

[GitHub Pages][pages] is an incredible feature that builds and updates your site every time you `git push` to GitHub. But it uses GitHub's own servers. For many reasons, you probably want to host your academic site on your own department's Web server.

I wrote [Hooknook][] as a way to get slick GitHub-Pages-like automatic updating on your own server.

## How it Works

It's easy to automate the deployment of a Jekyll site. I usually write a [Makefile target][make-deploy], called `deploy`, that builds my site and [rsync][]s it to my department's servers. It looks like this:

    deploy: clean site
        rsync --compress --recursive --checksum --itemize-changes --delete -e ssh _site/ $(CSEHOST):public_html/home

At this point, I can just type `make deploy` to upload my site to the servers. But that's no fun, and it's unlikely to fly with [technology-adverse][luis] [advisors][dan] who might also need to edit the site. They probably can't even be coaxed to install Jekyll. That's where [Hooknook][] comes in.

Hooknook works by running a small, special-purpose server. For me, this is an otherwise-useless Mac mini sitting under [my officemate][jrw]'s desk. If you don't have a little utility server like this, ask around: someone you know probably does.

Point a [GitHub Webhook][webhook] for your site's repository at your Hooknook instance. Every time you push to the repository, Hooknook will pull from it and run `make deploy`. Magical!

See [the README][hooknook] for more details about how to set up your own Hooknook server.

## Getting Fancy

As anyone who's ever debugged a cron job knows, running background tasks "automatically" can be maddeningly opaque. To help with this, Hooknook keeps the output of every deployment in a timestamped log file under `~/.hooknook/log/`. Check in there if something goes wrong.

It can even show you these logs over a Web interface. You configure Hooknook to allow a whitelist of GitHub usernames. Any of these users can then head to the server in a browser, log in with their GitHub credentials, and see a list of logs for the most recent deployments.
