    FCRC was fantastic; I'm still reeling from all the great people I met. I'm
    posting my [slides][slides] for the PLDI presentation and a [poster][poster]
    for the project. I also learned a little bit about research reporting in the
    media.

I've just returned from [PLDI 2011][pldi] at [FCRC][fcrc] in San Jose, where I
gave a talk about the [EnerJ][enerj] project. The conference was amazing, mostly
because of all the sharp and friendly people I met there. I hope to run into
everyone again many times at future conferences.

I have now posted the [slides for the PLDI talk][slides]. There's also a [very
simplistic poster][poster] about EnerJ that I made for recruiting undergraduate
collaborators (please [get in touch][email] if you're interested!).

In the lead-up to the conference, the EnerJ got a small amount of coverage in
the popular nerd press (thanks to [Hannah Hickey's article][pr] from the
[the University's news office][news]). We got short writeups in
[GeekWire][geekwire], [DailyTech][dt],
[Gizmag][gizmag], and, most prominently, [Engadget][engadget]. It was
interesting to see how non-academics reacted to simple synopses of the work---as
is typical of Internet comment sections, responses were of *variable levels of
thoughtfulness*. (I did enjoy all the comments comparing my advisor's photo to
Harry Potter and Kevin Connolly.) It was an interesting reminder of the
differences between academia and the rest of the world.
