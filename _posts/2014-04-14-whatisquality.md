title: What Is Quality, Anyway?
excerpt: |
    I made a video of a short talk I gave at a workshop recently.
    The talk is a call to research action: the approximate-computing community
    should be thinking more carefully about the problem of specifying
    quality---even when programmers don't know what quality means.

The notion of *output quality* is fundamental to approximate computing.
It's the basis of how we think about and evaluate research on approximation techniques.
Because it's so crucial to getting anything done, researchers tend to assume that quality is definable and measurable.
But for many applications, quality is a fuzzy notion: it's not clear at all how programmers can capture contextual, human reactions to output errors.

I recently gave a short talk about the problem of measuring quality in approximate applications.
In keeping with my [recent experiment]({{ site.base }}/blog/approxstorage.html}}) with recording the talks I prepare, I made a [five-minute video](http://youtu.be/F6mLeyJbBB4) for your entertainment.
