title: Use Jekyll for Your Academic Site
excerpt: |
    As a grad student, it's a great idea to build a personal academic Web site. There are many tools that can help you build a good one. I've tried many of them and I think you should use [Jekyll][].

If you're a grad student and building your personal academic Web site, you have many choices for tools. I think you should use [Jekyll][].

## You should make a personal site

In case you're not convinced yet, you (a grad student) should definitely have a Web site---and you should have a blog. There are so many reasons:

* Practice writing. Everyone can benefit from working on their writing skills, and that goes doubly in academia.
* A blog is a great place to express infantile, unpublishable ideas. Purely opinion-based writing doesn't go to conferences but can still be just as important as "real" research.
* Avoid repeating yourself. As [Matt Might says][mm], blogging can counter-intuitively *save* you time by helping you avoid writing the same email over and over.
* Demonstrate your brilliance for the world. Blogging helps give you something to talk about with people you meet elsewhere in the academic bubble.

## Use a static site generator

The world is [overflowing with CMSes][cms] and they are almost all crap. [WordPress][] might suck the least and even it is unconscionable. Because you're a nerd, what you want is a *static site generator*, which is a simple tool that takes a few text files and compiles them into a Web site. You can check your content and design into a VCS, [share your source on GitHub][gh], and use [scp][] to deploy output to your department's servers with zero setup on the host. Traditional CMSes can't do any of this.

[scp]: http://linux.die.net/man/1/scp
[cms]: http://www.cmsmatrix.org/

To be clear, you do *not* want to code the entire site entirely by hand. SSGs take the tedium out of making multiple pages look consistent, generating RSS feeds, and the like.

## The best static site generator is Jekyll

I've tried out a great many static site generators---[Hyde][], [Pelican][], [Nanoc][], and [Middleman][], to name a few---and [Jekyll][] is the best. There's almost nothing to an SSG, which is why so many people are tempted to write them ([I have been][stapler]). Jekyll is not better than the rest for any fundamental design reason; it's better because it's enormously popular and therefore excels in the long tail of details. It has great [documentation][jekyll-docs], a thriving plugin and tool ecosystem, and frequent bug fixes. In my experience, it has much fewer frustrating corner cases compared to Nanoc and Pelican.

[Nanoc]: http://nanoc.ws/
[Pelican]: http://docs.getpelican.com/
[Hyde]: http://hyde.github.io/

Jekyll isn't perfect, but it's as close as these things get.

If, like me, you secretly believe that everything is better if it's written in Python, I still suggest you start with Jekyll (which is done in Ruby). In my experience, using Jekyll does not require writing or reading a single line of Ruby.

I'm in the middle of moving my site from Nanoc to Jekyll. In case you need it, here's a [tiny Python script for translating Nanoc post files into Jekyll files][script].

## But Liquid templates are awful

One drawback to Jekyll currently is its template language, [Liquid][]. Whereas Jekyll excels in the details, Liquid dies by them. (Fortunately, the developers seem to be planning to [add alternative template languages][template-bug] in a future release.)

[template-bug]: https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/819
[Liquid]: http://liquidmarkup.org/

Here are some terrible things about Liquid that you should watch out for if you use Jekyll:

* The [documentation][liquid-docs] is miserable. For example, the language has expressions and operators, but I can't find any mention of them in the docs. See if you can find out from [this page][liquid-docs], for example, how to spell Boolean "and." Is it `and`? `&&`? `&`? Who knows?!
* Comments are written `{% raw %}{% comment %}like this{% endcomment %}{% endraw %}`. Seriously.
* How do you assign to a variable? Is it `a = b`? Nope: it's `assign a = b`, of course.
* No [template inheritance][inheritance].
* You can't say `not x`; you have to say `x != true`. Again, seriously.
* No [whitespace control][ws]. This means that every `{% raw %}{% if %}{% endraw %}` and `{% raw %}{% for %}{% endraw %}` you use craps up your HTML output with ugly spaces and newlines.

Liquid is awful, but Jekyll itself is so not-awful that it justifies putting up with Liquid's quirks.
