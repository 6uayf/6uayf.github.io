title: "The Apple ISA"
excerpt: |
    Apple is on track to diverge from ARM and x86 to design its own proprietary instruction set. This good for the future of hardware--software co-design.

[Apple][]'s institutional personality is easy to describe. Ruthless secrecy, monolithic opacity, taste. But perhaps more than anything else, Apple wants to own [the whole widget][whole widget].

<figure style="max-width: 325px;">

</figure>

It's not surprising, then, that Apple controls almost every bit of technology in its platform stacks. Apple makes its own [programming language][swift], it sets the rules for its [App Store][], and---since [2012][a6]---it's one of [only][intel] [a][amd] [handful][arm] [of][qualcomm] [players][nvidia] in the consumer CPU business. Apple has always embraced vertical integration over the rest of the industry's commodification, and recent years have only further consolidated its technology stack.

It *is* surprising that one last gap remains in the middle of this stack of system exclusivity: Apple [licenses][armlicense] the [instruction set architecture][isa] for its mobile devices from [ARM][].

Licensing an existing ISA might seem inevitable: when was the last time a brand-new ISA succeeded? ARM, [from 1985][armwiki], is a baby next to x86, which [dates to 1978][x86]. IBM still makes [new machines][systemz] binary-compatible with [its 1964 model][s360]. One does not simply walk into ISA design.

But recently, Apple announced that [Watch][] apps would be delivered as [LLVM IR][bitcode], not machine code: the ISA is completely hidden from third-party developers. Apple pundits have inferred that the bitcode development [presages ARM Macs][inertial lemon] or, even less plausibly, x86 phones. But it's more likely Apple will move away from both legacy ISAs.

Apple's outsourcing of this crucial piece at the heart of its systems looks increasingly incongruous as the need for interoperability with the broader ARM ecosystem evaporates. In the Apple stack, ARM today acts as a serialization format for [LLVM][] to convey information to the Apple microarchitecture. And it's certainly not the best serialization format: a traditional [von Neumann][] ISA like ARM incurs a [semantic gap][]; the architecture wastes time and energy rediscovering facts that the compiler already knew.

The computer architecture community has produced better alternatives to legacy ISAs, from [conservative extensions][greendroid] to [complete rethinkings][trips]. Apple itself has explored [macroscalar][], an unconventional ISA design for efficient [instruction-level parallelism][ilp], and [Nvidia][]'s [Denver][] core has already gone full [Transmeta][] with a custom architecture that just pretends to be an ARM. The need for [hardware--software co-design][snapl] is more urgent than ever in 2015, and it's only a matter of time until the industry dismantles the dusty abstractions that prevent serious co-design efforts. Apple has everything lined up to overhaul its hardware abstraction.

It may not come [tomorrow][sep9], but an Apple ISA is coming.
