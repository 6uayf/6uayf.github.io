    about the [Facebook fellowship][fbf] and energy-efficient computing. And I

Seattle's local public radio station, [KUOW][], invited me for a short interview
on their daily show, [Weekday][] with Steve Scher. We talked about the [Facebook
fellowship][fbf], our group's work on [approximate computing][enerj], UW CSE's
budget, and [Harvey Mudd][hmc] (my alma mater). You can [hear the program in
KUOW's archives][show] (my segment starts around 21:45). Steve is incredibly
friendly and a fantastic interviewer; I had a great time with my ten minutes of
public-radio fame.

Also, I had the pleasure of meeting [Jack Hitt][], one of my very favorite
[*This American Life*][tal]-ites, briefly in the green room. He was talking
about his one-man show, [*Making Up the Truth*][hittplay], after my interview.
His interview (also in the above audio archive) is way more interesting than
mine.
