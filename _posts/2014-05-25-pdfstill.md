title: Embedding Fonts in PDFs
excerpt: |
    Conference and journal publishers want PDFs with fonts embedded. The Web is full of bad, incomplete, and broken advice about how to embed fonts. Here's a tiny script that does it right.

Submitting camera-ready final papers is one of the many mundane tasks that make up the non-research part of grad school. We've all done it: had [Sheridan Printing][sheridan] or whomever reject our final version because it didn't embed its fonts. (It's a mystery as to why it's possible to create PDFs that work fine on one machine and break on others.)

So you need to embed fonts in your PDF. The world is full of broken or overcomplicated advice, including the depressing suggestion that you buy [Adobe Distiller][distiller], which has been discontinued since 2013.

Here's a tiny script that just does the right thing. You will need two dependencies: [Ghostscript][] and [exiftool][]. On a Mac with [Homebrew][], this is as easy as:

    brew install ghostscript
    brew install exiftool

Then paste [this minuscule shell script][gist] into a file (I call it `pdfstill`):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sampsyo/898489dd2672c5d1af36.js"></script>

You can grab this script real quick like this:

    curl -O https://gist.github.com/sampsyo/898489dd2672c5d1af36/raw/pdfstill
    chmod a+x pdfstill

The command `pdfstill paper.pdf` will produce `paper.still.pdf`, ready to satisfy your conference's friendly publishing ogres.
