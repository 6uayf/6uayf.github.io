title: Redesign
excerpt: |
    I updated this site's design so that it sucks a little bit less. Within: some ideas and techniques you can steal.
---
After three years with the old one, this site has a new look. It disposes with tacky notched design elements, a hard-to-read font, pass&eacute; drop shadows, and some creepy pictures of me:

<img src="{{ site.base }}/media/oldsite.png"
    class="img-responsive"
    alt="screenshot of the old site">

and adds responsiveness via [Bootstrap][].

The new design [is open source][gh], so please fork it and steal anything you like if you're [setting up your site][jekyll-post]. Here are a few things you might want to borrow:

[gh]: https://github.com/sampsyo/home
[jekyll-post]: {{ site.base }}/blog/jekyll.html
[Bootstrap]: http://getbootstrap.com/

* Use [Less][] to customize Bootstrap with your own colors, fonts, and such without ugly post-facto monkey-patching. Steal my [Makefile][], which encapsulates a workflow for building real CSS from Less.
* That Makefile also has a `make deploy` target that uploads the whole thing to the department's servers.
* Some [template nonsense][nav-tmpl] for highlighting the correct tab in a navigation bar.

[nav-tmpl]: https://github.com/sampsyo/home/blob/master/_layouts/default.html#L31
[Less]: http://lesscss.org/
[Makefile]: https://github.com/sampsyo/home/blob/master/Makefile
