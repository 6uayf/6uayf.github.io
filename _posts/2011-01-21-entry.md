I've finally gotten around to setting up an academic blog. I am certain that
this is the beginning of my meteoric rise to computer science superstardom.

The blog is built with [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/), a pretty good
static Web site compiler. I'm using
[bib2xhtml](http://www.spinellis.gr/sw/textproc/bib2xhtml/)
to format citations and a little bit of custom glue to compile them
automatically with nanoc.
