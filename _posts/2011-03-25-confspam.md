    If you're like me, you're probably not very interested in the latest
    deadline extension for the First Annual Multiconference on Informatics and
    Cybernetics. Here's a filter for Gmail that catches most of this kind of
    conference spam.

If you have ever even thought about attending a computer science conference,
you're
probably on a million mailing lists that send you *conference spam:* invitations
to shifty-sounding Multiconferences and Symposia on such topics as
Informatics or Cyberwhatever. I've found that Gmail's spam filter isn't very
good at catching this kind of spam, so I've built up a custom filter that
catches almost all of the conference spam I receive.

To get a little inbox peace of mind: in Gmail, go into
Settings and then Filters and create a new filter. Change the domain names at
the end of this string and paste it into the **Has the words:** box on the
filter setup screen:

    (multi-conference | multiconference | subject:informatics |
    subject:"registration open" | subject:cfp |
    subject:"call for papers" | (cfp subject:("deadline extension" |
    symposium))) -from:(washington.edu | hmc.edu)

Those last two criteria prevent CFPs from people I probably know (sending from
`washington.edu` or `hmc.edu`) from being caught in the filter. Change those to
reflect the institutions you want to whitelist.

This filter has squelched a couple hundred pieces conference spam for me over
the last year or so. <a href="mailto:asampson@cs.washington.edu">Let me know</a>
if you have a filter that improves on this one.
