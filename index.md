I am a new SEW assistant professor (aka postdoc) in the [Department of Mathematics][ucsdmath] at [University of California at San Diego][ucsd]. I received B.A. from [St Lawrence University][slu] in 2010 and Ph.D. from [Courant Institute][courant], [New York University][nyu] in 2016 under the supervision of [C. Sinan Gunturk][Sinan].

My research interests broadly fall within mathematical signal processing. More specifically, I have studied quantization theory and analog-to-digital conversion methods with particular emphasis on the settings of frame theory, compressive sampling, and phase retrieval. I have utilized techniques from applied harmonic analysis, probability theory, and optimization to attack problems from such settings.
