I design better hardware--software abstractions through research in programming languages and computer architecture.
Much of my work is on
*approximate computing:* the idea that computers can be much more efficient
if they are allowed to be imperfect.
To help programmers trade off accuracy for efficiency, we need new [languages][enerj], [tools][passert], [processors][truffle], [accelerators][npu], [memories][storage], and [compilers][accept].

I will start as an assistant professor in the [Department of Computer Science][cornellcs] at [Cornell University][cornell] in the fall of 2016.
Until then, I am visiting [Microsoft Research][msr] in the [RiSE][] group.
I graduated with my Ph.D. from the [University of Washington][uw cse] this year.
Before that, I was at [Harvey Mudd College][hmc].
Here's my [CV][].
