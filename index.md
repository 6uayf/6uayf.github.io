I am a new SEW assistant professor (aka postdoc) in the [Department of Mathematics][ucsdmath] at [University of California at San Diego][ucsd].

My research interests broadly fall within mathematical signal processing. More specifically, I have studied quantization theory and analog-to-digital conversion methods with particular emphasis on the settings of frame theory, compressive sampling, and phase retrieval. I have utilized techniques from applied harmonic analysis, probability theory, and optimization to attack problems from such settings.
