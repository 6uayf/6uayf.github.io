If you're curious about research in computer science, I want you to [apply to the Ph.D. program at Cornell CS][csapply] or [in ECE][eceapply].
Cornell has a top-notch, world-class research program.
It's especially strong in the spectrum of computer systems topics: programming languages, compilers, operating systems, networks, security, and architecture.
I want to work with tenacious, creative new students who are curious about these topics when I start as an assistant professor there next fall.
Please tell everyone you know to apply.
The deadline's December 15 for both departments.

I'll let these 6 puppies explain why Cornell is the perfect CS program for you.
