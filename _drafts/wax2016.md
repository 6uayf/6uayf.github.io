title: "Notes on WAX 2016"
excerpt: |
    [WAX][] is the workshop on approximate computing. This year at [ASPLOS][], I organized the third or fourth iteration, depending on how you count, along with [Luis Ceze][luis], [Hadi Esmaeilzadeh][hadi], and [Ben Zorn][ben]. Here's some stuff that happened at the workshop.

We held [WAX][], the workshop on approximate computing, at [ASPLOS][] last week. I love organizing WAX---it's been a great excuse for the approximation community to talk about the broader themes that extend beyond any single person's research project du jour.

Here are some notes on those themes.

### Disgruntled Introductions

To introduce themselves, we had everyone say something they liked about approximate computing and something they didn't like.
Predictably, this invited a healthy dose of griping.
Two gripey themes emerged:

- People are unhappy that approximation hasn't "hit it big" yet, commercially speaking. We're a half decade or so into the approximate-computing craze already, so it feels to many like we should see shipping hardware sometime soon.
- Many people complained about the confusing terminology. What does *quality* mean versus *accuracy* versus *quality of service?* A cohort even complained about *approximate computing* itself being more popular than alternatives like *inexact* or *good-enough* computing.

### Cross-Stack Keynotes

We had two awesome keynote speakers, both of whom had interdisciplinary views on approximation.

[Matthai Philipose][matthai] from MSR has a goal of *continuous mobile vision:* always-on CV on a wearable device with all-day battery life and reasonable cloud costs.
He has data suggesting that approximation is critical---not just a luxury---for this setting: current vision techniques can't fit in the energy and dollar budgets you'd need. It's not even close.
So his project introduces approximation everywhere, from the camera sensor hardware to the DNN models and algorithms.

[Naveen Verma][naveen] from Princeton is a hardware researcher but, unlike some architects, believes approximate computing should come top down, from algorithms.
He showed off *data-driven hardware resilience*, where you train a machine learning model to counteract the effects of deterministic hardware approximation.
This cross-stack approach can lead to extremely good tolerance under the right conditions.

### Best Practices

The discussion at the end of the day coalesced around standards of rigor---or lack thereof---in approximate-computing research.
There was a broad consensus in particular that evaluation methodologies have not improved enough since those heady days of the first few approximation papers.
We agreed that there's a strong need for a *best practices* document for approximation research, covering:

- Standard benchmarks with standard quality metrics and standard thresholds. When people are free to define their own quality metrics, there's no way to compare two papers---and no way to trust that an approximation is actually useful. The *de facto* 10% loss standard is my least favorite legacy of [the EnerJ paper][enerj].
- A map of the space of approximation techniques available. If you want to apply approximation to a bottleneck in your favorite application, where should you start? This kind of mapping is common for traditional performance optimization, so we should have one too.
- Agreement on what *kinds* of quality guarantees are worth striving for. Where do statistical guarantees make sense, and where do we need more traditional deterministic bounds?

I'm excited about this idea for a community-sanctioned set of standards, but it's going to be difficult because it doesn't fit with normal academic incentives: this won't get anyone an ISCA paper.

### A Better Workshop Next Year

I have plenty to learn about organizing workshops.
Here are some things we need to fix:

- One-minute lightning talks are a staple at WAX, but they need work. (1) Lightning talks are supposed to be an effortless and fun way to provoke discussion, but people recently have put too much work into them---a high standard means a low turnout. (2) Even so, I heard reactions that 60 seconds aren't enough to communicate a whole idea. We need ideas to keep the lightning round's lighthearted spirit while making it more useful.
- Many people told me the free-form, small-group lunch discussions were their favorite part of WAX. This was doubly true for new people and outsiders, who got to ask questions that wouldn't work in front of a whole-workshop audience. We need to create more of this kind of discussion, ideally by replacing the usual anemic post-talk Q&A. Maybe we can get seating at small round tables for the next WAX, or we could steal [Lindsay Kuper][kuper]'s [card-based Q&A][cards] idea.
- We need to remind speakers to skip their motivation slides: at a topic-focused workshop, we're all on the same page already.

Next year, I'd like to get the WAX franchise more organized. Haphazardly cobbling things together one year at a time has been fun, but the workshop is getting bigger and more serious. We should assign real roles, like *program chair* and *publicity chair*, which means we'll need more help. Please [get in touch](mailto:asampson@cornell.edu) if you'd like to help---and thanks to all the people who already volunteered!

See you at WAX 2017.
