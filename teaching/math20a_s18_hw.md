#### Homework

There are two types of homework assignments: *Online homework* submitted through WebAssign and *offline homework* from the 
textbook. The offline homework from the textbook is not to be turned in and will not be graded. The due dates given for 
the offline homework are given as an indication of when they should be done. The purpose of the offline homework 
assignments is to provide more exercises for practice and understanding. Additionally, exam questions may be based 
on textbook questions.

##### Online Homework . 

Online homework will be done using WebAssign. WebAssign can be accessed from within TritonEd under "Tools". 
If you enrolled after the first day of classes, it might take a day or two before you make it into the system.  

  - To get an access code for WebAssign, you can either (1) purchase the textbook from the UCSD Bookstore, 
which comes bundled with a multi-term WebAssign access code, or (2) purchase ELECTRONIC ONLY access from the WebAssign 
website (after first logging in through TritonEd).  
  - Homework is due at 11:59 P.M.  
  - Due dates are posted in WebAssign.  
  - Homework may not be submitted after the due date.

##### Offline (Textbook) Homework

(Updated 4/3/2018)
These assignments will not be turned in and will be not graded; however, certain exam questions are based on textbook 
homework problems, so understanding the solutions to these problems should help you perform better on the exams. The due 
dates given for the offline homework are given as an indication of when they should be done, but does not indicate 
any actual deadline.  

This list is subject to revision during the term. Please check regularly for updates.

###### Homework 0 (Review)

Due As Necessary (no online homework)

Reading: Sections 1.4 - 1.6.  This should be review, so we will not cover these topics during lecture. You are advised to carefully read the sections to make sure you understand the topics very well, because they will appear again and again throughout the course.  Mathematics builds on previous concepts, so without a good understanding of these sections, you will struggle with the remainder of the course. 

Note: Homework 0 does not appear in the online homework.  This assignment is review and will not be graded.
