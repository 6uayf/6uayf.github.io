#### Syllabus

**Course:**  Math 20D  ([Course Catalog][courseCat])  

[courseCat]:http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html#math20d

**Title:** Introduction to Differential Equations

**Credit Hours:** 4 units

**Prerequisite:** Math 20C (or equivalent)

**Catalog Description:** Ordinary differential equations: exact, separable, and linear; constant coefficients, undetermined coefficients, variation of parameters. Series solutions. Systems, Laplace transforms. Computing symbolic and graphical solutions using Matlab.

**Textbook:** Elementary Differential Equations (11th Edition) by Boyce and DiPrima.   

**Material Covered:**  We shall cover parts of chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the Boyce and DiPrima text. A list of topics scheduled to be covered each day can be found on the  Course Calendar.  

**Lecture:** Attending the lecture is a fundamental part of the course; you are responsible for all material presented in the lecture whether or not it is discussed in the textbook. You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture.

**Reading:** Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading whether or not it is discussed in the lecture. It will be expected that you read the assigned material in advance of each lecture.  

**Calculators:** A graphing calculator (e.g., TI-83, TI-84, or TI-89) is recommended for homework assignments and as an aid in learning concepts. *The use of calculators will NOT be permitted during exams.*  

**Homework:** 
  


**Midterm Exams:** 

**Final Exam:** 

**Make-up Exams:**  Make-up exams will not be given. If you miss a midterm exam for any reason, then your course grade will be computed using Method 2. (See below.)

**Grading:** Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the term and will be based on the following scale:  

|A+   | A   |A-   |B+	  |B	|B-   |C+   |C	  |C-	|D    |  
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|  
|97   |93   |90   |87   |83	|80   |77   |73   |70	|60   |  


I may adjust the scale to be more lenient, but guarantee that the grade corresponding to a given percentage will not be lower than specified by the above scale. Your cumulative average will be the best of the following two weighted averages:  

* 10% HW,   8% MATLAB,   2% Quizzes,   20% Midterm 1,   20% Midterm 2,   40% Final Exam
* 10% HW,   8% MATLAB,   2% Quizzes,   20% Best Midterm Exam,   60% Final Exam  

You must pass the final examination in order to pass the course. Note: Since *there are no makeup exams*, if you miss an exam for any reason then your course grade will be computed with the final exam counting 60% of your weighted average.

**Gradescope:** Exam grading will be done using an online tool called [Gradescope][GS]. Exams will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope and will be graded within it. As a consequence, exams will not be returned to the students. Instead, a digital version of your exams will be made available after the grading has been completed. An email will be sent from Gradescope when the exams are made available.

**Regrades:** Regrade requests will be made using the built-in regrade request feature in Gradescope. There will be a limited window of time after the exams are made available during which the regrade request feature will be active. This time window will be announced when the exam scores are released to the students.

**Academic Dishonesty:** Academic dishonesty is considered a serious offense at UCSD. Students caught cheating will face an administrative sanction which may include suspension or expulsion from the university. Click here for more information.
