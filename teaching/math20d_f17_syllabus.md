#### Syllabus
---

**Course:**  Math 20D  ([Course Catalog][courseCat])  

[courseCat]:http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html#math20d

**Title:** Introduction to Differential Equations

**Credit Hours:** 4 units

**Prerequisite:** Math 20C (or equivalent)

**Catalog Description:** Ordinary differential equations: exact, separable, and linear; constant coefficients, undetermined coefficients, variation of parameters. Series solutions. Systems, Laplace transforms. Computing symbolic and graphical solutions using Matlab.

**Textbook:** Elementary Differential Equations (11th Edition) by Boyce and DiPrima.   

**Material Covered:**  We shall cover parts of chapters 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7 of the Boyce and DiPrima text. A list of topics scheduled to be covered each day can be found on the  Course Calendar.  

**Lecture:** Attending the lecture is a fundamental part of the course; you are responsible for all material presented in the lecture whether or not it is discussed in the textbook. You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture.

**Reading:** Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading whether or not it is discussed in the lecture. It will be expected that you read the assigned material in advance of each lecture.  

**Calculators:** A graphing calculator (e.g., TI-83, TI-84, or TI-89) is recommended for homework assignments and as an aid in learning concepts. *The use of calculators will NOT be permitted during exams.*  

**Labs:**   The MATLAB assignments are a required part of the course. The assignments, due dates, and instructions on how to submit the assignments can be found here:

<http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~math20d/>

There will be MATLAB tutors available in B432 to help you with your assignments.  

*MATLAB Quiz:*   There will be a MATLAB quiz given at the end of the quarter. The quiz will be held during your scheduled MATLAB time in AP&M B432. If you are unable to make the scheduled time, you will be able to schedule an alternate time online. The MATLAB Quiz can be used to replace one MATLAB assignment.

**Quizzes:** There will be 4 quizzes during discussion sessions (see [Calendar][cal] for the dates). I will drop the lowest one.

**Homework:** Homework is a very important part of the course and in order to fully master the topics it is essential that you work carefully on every assignment and try your best to complete every problem. You have to submit online homework through WileyPLUS (Login Triton -> click on Tools --> click on WileyPlus). Click [here][hw] to read more information.    

Homework may not be submitted late. No homework scores will be dropped at the end of the quarter.
Homework due dates are chosen to help students keep to the pace of the course and stay current with the topics covered in the lectures. The "No late homework" policy is designed to encourage students to complete homework assignments on time and reward those who do.

**Exams:** There will be two midterm exams and a final exam. Check the  [Course Calendar][cal]  for the exact dates of the midterm and final exams. You may use one 8.5 x 11 inch page of handwritten notes. (Both sides are okay, but no photocopies are allowed.) You may not use any other notes or any electronic devices. Please bring your student ID to the exams.  

  You may bring ONE 8.5 x 11 inch sheet of handwritten notes. You may use both sides. (No photocopies!) . 
  No calculators will be allowed during the examinations.  
  We will not be using Blue Books for exams this quarter.  

[cal]:http://thanghuynh.org/teaching/math20d_f17_cal.html

**Final Exam:** It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination.
You should not enroll in this class if you cannot sit for the final examination at its scheduled time. You must pass the final exam ( >59% ) in order to pass the class. (The actual required percentage may be lowered, depending on overall class performance.)


**Make-up Exams:**  Make-up exams will not be given. If you miss a midterm exam for any reason, then your course grade will be computed using Method 2. (See below.)

**Grading:** Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the term and will be based on the following scale:  

<center>        
<table class="grades" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>A+</b></td>
<td><b>A</b></td>
<td><b>A-</b></td>
<td><b>B+</b></td>
<td><b>B</b></td>
<td><b>B-</b></td>
<td><b>C+</b></td>
<td><b>C</b></td>
<td><b>C-</b></td>
<td><b>D</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>97</b></td>
<td><b>93</b></td>
<td><b>90</b></td>
<td><b>87</b></td>
<td><b>83</b></td>
<td><b>80</b></td>
<td><b>77</b></td>
<td><b>73</b></td>
<td><b>70</b></td>
<td><b>60</b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>



I may adjust the scale to be more lenient, but guarantee that the grade corresponding to a given percentage will not be lower than specified by the above scale. Your cumulative average will be the best of the following two weighted averages:  

* 6% HW,   8% MATLAB,   6% Quizzes,   20% Midterm 1,   20% Midterm 2,   40% Final Exam
* 6% HW,   8% MATLAB,   6% Quizzes,   20% Best Midterm Exam,   60% Final Exam  

You must pass the final examination in order to pass the course. Note: Since *there are no makeup exams*, if you miss an exam for any reason then your course grade will be computed with the final exam counting 60% of your weighted average.  

*Note on MATLAB grades:*  There are four labs. Each of these four is worth 2% of your grade (for 8% total). The MATLAB Quiz at the end of the quarter can be used to replace one MATLAB assignment. 

**There will be no curve**, but we may adjust the scale to be more lenient (depending on the overall performance of the class). 

Please notice that outside factors, including the need for a certain grade for admission/retention in any academic program, scholarship or transfer credit, graduation requirements or personal desire for a specific grade DO NOT appear in the above calculations, and thus are not considered in any way in the determination of your course grade. Effort, improvement, class attendance and participation will all dramatically improve your grade in the course in that they will allow you to do well on quizzes, exams, and the final exam. They will NOT, however, actively participate in the calculation of your course grade. 


**Gradescope:** Exam grading will be done using an online tool called [Gradescope][GS]. Exams will be scanned and uploaded to Gradescope and will be graded within it. As a consequence, exams will not be returned to the students. Instead, a digital version of your exams will be made available after the grading has been completed. An email will be sent from Gradescope when the exams are made available.  

[GS]:https://gradescope.com/  

**Regrades:** Regrade requests will be made using the built-in regrade request feature in Gradescope. There will be a limited window of time after the exams are made available during which the regrade request feature will be active. This time window will be announced when the exam scores are released to the students.

**Academic Dishonesty:** Academic dishonesty is considered a serious offense at UCSD. Students caught cheating will face an administrative sanction which may include suspension or expulsion from the university. Click here for more information.
