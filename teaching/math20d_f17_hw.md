##### <a name="hmwk0"></a>Homework 0  (No due date)  

*Sections* 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

*Sections* 2.1, 2.2, 2.3

**Comments:**  We will not spend time in class discussing 2.3 (Modeling with First Order Equations), but this section gives valuable insight into why exactly we want to study differential equations and find their solutions. You should definitely read it.

##### Homework 2     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Oct 17)

*Sections* 2.4, 2.5, 2.6

##### Homework 3     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Oct 24)
