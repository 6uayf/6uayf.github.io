#### Homework  
---  

##### <a name="hmwk0"></a>Homework 0  (No due date)  

*Sections* 1.1, 1.2, 1.3

**Comments:**  We will not discuss these sections in detail in class, but you should read them. They introduce several key ideas that we will revisit throughout the course.  

##### <a name="hmwk1"></a>Homework 1  (Online HW Due Friday, Oct 13)

*Sections* 2.1, 2.2, 2.3

**Comments:**  We will not spend time in class discussing 2.3 (Modeling with First Order Equations), but this section gives valuable insight into why exactly we want to study differential equations and find their solutions. You should definitely read it.

##### Homework 2     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Oct 17)

*Sections* 2.4, 2.5, 2.6

##### Homework 3     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Oct 24)

*Sections* 3.1, 3.2, 3.3

##### Homework 4     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Oct 31)

*Sections* 3.4, 3.5, 3.6

**Comments:**  Pay special attention to Table 3.5.1. We likely will not have time to deal with each case in class.

##### Homework 5     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Nov 7)

*Sections* 7.1, 7.2

Comments:  Read Sections 1 and 2 in the Math 20D Supplement. These are based on Sections 7.1 and 7.2 in the textbook, but restricted to the 2x2 matrix case.

Homework 6     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Nov 14)
Sections 7.3, 7.4

Comments:  Read Sections 3 and 4 in the Math 20D Supplement. These are based on Sections 7.3 and 7.4 in the textbook, but restricted to the 2x2 matrix case.

Homework 7     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Nov 21)
Sections 7.5, 7.6

Comments:  Read Sections 5 and 6 in the Math 20D Supplement. These are based on Sections 7.5 and 7.6 in the textbook, but restricted to the 2x2 matrix case. We will not cover Section 7.7, which applies to matrices larger than 2x2.

Homework 8     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Nov 28)
Sections 7.8, 5.1, 5.2

Comments:  (1) Read Section 8 in the Math 20D Supplement. This is based on Section 7.8 in the textbook, but restricted to the 2x2 matrix case.  (2) Section 5.1 is a review of power series. Since this was covered in Math 20B, which is a prerequisite for this course, we will not discuss 5.1 explicitly in class. You are, however, expected to know this material, and so you should read it before we discuss Section 5.2 in class.

Homework 9     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Dec 5)
Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3

Homework 10     (No due dateâ€”No homework is due during Final Exam Week)
Sections 6.4, 6.5, 6.6
