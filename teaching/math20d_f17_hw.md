Homework assignments will be completed and submitted online using the WileyPLUS online homework system. Access WileyPLUS from within TritonEd under "Tools". (If you enrolled after the first day of classes, it might take a day or two before you make it into the system.) In order to use WileyPLUS, you must have a valid WileyPLUS Online Homework code (see below).

*Textbook:*  Elementary Differential Equations (11th Edition) by Boyce and DiPrima 
*WileyPLUS Login:*  Login from within TritonEd (<https://tritoned.ucsd.edu>)

**Using WileyPLUS** Access WileyPLUS from within TritonEd under "Tools". You will need a WileyPLUS access code.

ACCESS CODES  
  To get an access code for WileyPLUS, you can either (1) purchase it from the UCSD Bookstore, which can come with or without a loose-leaf binder-ready version of the textbook, or (2) purchase it from WileyPLUS directly (after first logging in through TritonEd). 
  If you already have a multi-term access code (because you took Math 20D last quarter, for example) then you may use the same code. (This is unlikely to be the case this quarter, because we are using a new edition of the textbook.) 

Guidelines for submission through WileyPLUS: You have only THREE attempts for each question in an assignment labeled "Multiple Choice". All homework is due at 11:59 P.M.



#### Homework

*Sections* 2.1, 2.2, 2.3

**Comments:**  We will not spend time in class discussing 2.3 (Modeling with First Order Equations), but this section gives valuable insight into why exactly we want to study differential equations and find their solutions. You should definitely read it.

##### Homework 2     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Oct 17)

*Sections* 2.4, 2.5, 2.6

##### Homework 3     (Online HW Due Tuesday, Oct 24)
