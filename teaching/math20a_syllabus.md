#### Syllabus
---

**Course:**  Math 20A  ([Course Catalog][courseCat])  

[courseCat]:http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/courses/MATH.html#math20a

**Title:** Calculus for Science and Engineering

**Credit Hours:** 4 units

**Prerequisite:**  Math Placement Exam qualifying score, or AP Calculus AB score of 2 or 3 (or equivalent AB subscore on BC exam), or SAT II Math 2C score of 650 or higher, or Math 4C with a grade of C– or better, or Math 10A with a grade of C– or better.

**Catalog Description:** Integral calculus of one variable and its applications, with exponential, logarithmic, hyperbolic, and trigonometric functions.  Methods of integration.  Polar coordinates in the plane.

**Textbook:** *Calculus: Early Transcendentals*, third edition, by Jon Rogawski and Colin Adams; published by W. H. Freeman and Company; 2015   

**Material Covered:**  We shall cover parts of Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the text.  

**Lecture:** Attending the lecture is a fundamental part of the course; you are responsible for all material presented in the lecture whether or not it is discussed in the textbook. You should expect questions on the exams that will test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture.

**Reading:** Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment; you are responsible for material in the assigned reading whether or not it is discussed in the lecture. It will be expected that you read the assigned material in advance of each lecture.  

**Calculators:** A graphing calculator (e.g., TI-83, TI-84, or TI-89) is recommended for homework assignments and as an aid in learning concepts. *The use of calculators will NOT be permitted during exams.*  

**Calculus Tutoring Lab:** A tutoring lab for Calculus students will generally be open Monday through Friday; please see the [Calculus Tutoring page][callab] and follow the link in the Calculus Tutoring section for a complete listing of dates and times when the tutoring lab is open.

**Homework:** Graded homework will be assigned using WebAssign and will be accessible via TritonEd.
Additional textbook homework exercises are posted on the course textbook homework page with the same due date as
the WebAssign homework. The textbook homework exercises will not be collected and will not be graded; 
however, if you seek help from the instructor or TAs, they will often do these problems.

  * Online homework will be done through WebAssign via TritonEd.
  * No homework assignment scores will be dropped at the end of the quarter.
  

**Exams:** There will be two midterm exams and a final exam. Check the  [Course Calendar][cal]  for the exact dates 
of the midterm and final exams. You may use one 8.5 x 11 inch page of handwritten notes. 
(Both sides are okay, but no photocopies are allowed.) You may not use any other notes or any electronic devices. 
Please bring your student ID to the exams. *There will be no makeup exams.*

**Final Exam:** It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not have a schedule conflict involving the final examination.
You should not enroll in this class if you cannot sit for the final examination at its scheduled time. 
You must pass the final exam ( >59% ) in order to pass the class. (The actual required percentage may be lowered, 
depending on overall class performance.)

**Regrade Policy:** Your exams will be graded using Gradescope. You will be able to request a regrade directly from 
your TA for a specified window of time.  Be sure to make your request within the specified window of time; no 
regrade requests will be accepted after the deadline.

**Make-up Exams:**  Make-up exams will not be given. If you miss a midterm exam for any reason, 
then your course grade will be computed using Method 2. (See below.)

**Administrative Deadline:**  It is your responsibility to check that your exam scores and WebAssign homework scores on TritonEd are correct.  
Contact your TA before the end of the 10th week of the quarter to resolve recording errors.  

  * Questions regarding missing or incorrectly recorded exam scores or WebAssign homework scores will not be considered after the last day of instruction.
  * Be sure to check that your exam scores entered in TritonEd are the same as your exam scores published on Gradescope.


**Grading:** Your course grade will be determined by your cumulative average at the end of the term and 
will be based on the following scale:  

<center>        
<table class="grades" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>A+</b></td>
<td><b>A</b></td>
<td><b>A-</b></td>
<td><b>B+</b></td>
<td><b>B</b></td>
<td><b>B-</b></td>
<td><b>C+</b></td>
<td><b>C</b></td>
<td><b>C-</b></td>
<td><b>D</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>97</b></td>
<td><b>93</b></td>
<td><b>90</b></td>
<td><b>87</b></td>
<td><b>83</b></td>
<td><b>80</b></td>
<td><b>77</b></td>
<td><b>73</b></td>
<td><b>70</b></td>
<td><b>60</b></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</center>



I may adjust the scale to be more lenient, but guarantee that the grade corresponding to a given percentage will not be lower than specified by the above scale. Your cumulative average will be the best of the following two weighted averages:  

* 20% HW,  20% Midterm 1,   20% Midterm 2,   40% Final Exam
* 20% HW,  20% Best Midterm Exam,   60% Final Exam  

You must pass the final examination in order to pass the course. Note: Since *there are no makeup exams*, if you miss an exam for any reason then your course grade will be computed with the final exam counting 60% of your weighted average.  

**There will be no curve**, but we may adjust the scale to be more lenient (depending on the overall performance of the class). 

Please notice that outside factors, including the need for a certain grade for admission/retention in any academic 
program, scholarship or transfer credit, graduation requirements or personal desire for a specific grade DO NOT appear 
in the above calculations, and thus are not considered in any way in the determination of your course grade. 
Effort, improvement, class attendance and participation will all dramatically improve your grade in the course in 
that they will allow you to do well on quizzes, exams, and the final exam. They will NOT, however, actively participate 
in the calculation of your course grade. 

**Academic Dishonesty:** Academic dishonesty is considered a serious offense at UCSD. Students caught cheating will face an administrative sanction which may include suspension or expulsion from the university. Click here for more information.
