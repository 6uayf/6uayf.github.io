**Lecture**

**Discussion Sections:**

**Prerequisite:** Math 20F: Linear Algebra

**Catalog Description:**  
Analysis of numerical methods for linear algebraic systems and least squares problems. Orthogonalization methods. 
Ill conditioned problems. Eigenvalue and singular value computations. Three lectures, one recitation.
Knowledge of programming recommended.

**Textbook:** *Fundamentals of Matrix Computations, Third Edition*, by Watkins.

**Subject Material:** We will cover parts of Chapers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 8. (See calendar for specific details.)

**Reading:** Reading the assigned material in advance of each lecture is expected. This will keep the reading interesting and give the lectures more clarity. Reading the sections of the textbook corresponding to the assigned homework exercises is considered part of the homework assignment. You are responsible for material in the assigned reading whether or not it is discussed in the lecture.

**Lecture:** Attending the lecture is a fundamental part of the course. You are responsible for material presented in the lecture whether or not it is discussed in the textbook. You should expect questions on the exams to test your understanding of concepts discussed in the lecture and in the homework assignments.

**Calculators:** A graphing calculator is recommended: a TI-83 or TI-84 (or similar model) suffices for this course, but you may wish to consider acquiring a more powerful calculator (such as a TI-89) if you think you might use it for other courses. The calculator should be used only as an aid in learning concepts, not just as a means of computation. Note: The use of calculators will not be permitted during exams.

**Homework:** Homework exercises will be assigned Fridays on the course homework page and they are due on the subsequent Friday in your TA's dropbox in the basement of AP&M by 4pm.

**Midterm Exams:** There will be two midterm exams, one given on Wednesday, April 22 and the other on Wednesday, May 13 during class (see the course calendar). No calculators or notes will be allowed during the midterm exams. Students will not be allowed to take makeup midterm exams.

**Final Examination:** The final examination will be held at the following time:

8:00--11:00am Monday, June 8 (See the course calendar.)
No calculators or notes will be allowed during the final examination.

**Regrades:** Midterm exams will be returned in the discussion sections. If you wish to have your exam regraded, you must return it immediately to your TA. Regrade requests will not be considered once your exam leaves the room. If you do not retrieve your exam during discussion section, you must arrange to pick it up from your TA within one week after it was returned in order for any regrade request to be considered.

**Grading:** Your grade will be based on the scores of the homework, two midterms, and one final exam with the lowest homework grade dropped. It will be calculated from taking the maximum of the scores defined below:

(10% HW) + (25% Midterm) + (25% Midterm) + (40% Final)
(10% HW) + (25% Best Midterm) + (5% Other Midterm) + (60% Final)
Min of (HW,Best Midterm,Final)

**Academic Dishonesty:** Academic dishonesty is considered a serious offense at UCSD. Students caught cheating will face an administrative sanction which may include suspension or expulsion from the university. It is in your best interest to maintain your academic integrity.

**Accomodations:** Students with special needs or disabilities must provide an Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter issued by the Oce for Students with Disabilities (OSD) as soon as possible. Please call OSD at 858-534-4382 or visit http://disabilities.ucsd.edu for more information
